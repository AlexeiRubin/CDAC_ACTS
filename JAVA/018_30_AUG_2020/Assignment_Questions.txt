1. 	Create multi threaded java application --- having 3 threads
	main , even , odd.

	Create EvenPrinterThread  & OddPrinterThread classes.
	
	Accept from user (in main thread)-- start & end values.
	
	Pass these values from main to child threads
	
	Even no printer thread  should print even nos within range, with small delay (sleep)
	
	Odd no printer thread should print odd nos within range , with small delay (sleep)
	
	Ensure no orphans.

	1.1 Solve above using extends Thread first.
	
	1.2 Then implement Runnable scenario for the same.

2. 	Extra optional assignment(application of threads with collection n I/O)
	(refer to day16.3 : eclipse project pls.)
	
	Copy only core classes --Student , Subject n Address.
	
	Copy StudentCollctionUtils class  
	
	2.1 Refer to  method in 
		public static Map<String,Student> populateMap(List<Student> students)
		{
			//already exists!
		}
	
	2.2 Create a multi threaded application for saving student details in 2 text files(taken from the Map) : (in student_gpa.txt : sorted by gpa & in student_dob.txt : sorted by dob) using 2 different threads , concurrently!
	For sorting must use custom ordering + anonymous inner class.
