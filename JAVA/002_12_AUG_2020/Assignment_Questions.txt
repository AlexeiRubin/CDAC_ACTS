1.  Create a java application for the following.
    Create a Customer class , with data members (all private : tight encapsulation)
    name(String),email(String),age(int), creditLimit(double)

	1.1 Supply a parameterized constructor to accept all details from user

	1.2 Supply an argument less  constructor to init default name to "lol" , email to "lol@lol.com",age=25,creditLimit=10000

	1.3 Supply another constructor , to init default creditLimit to 15000, taking rest of the i/ps from user.

	1.4 Write a method , getDetails to return string form of customer name & credit limit details.

	1.5 Supply getter & setter for creditLimit.

    NOTE : Currently constructor chaining is not discussed. But can be discussed in the lab & make use of it then.

	1.6 Create a TestCustomer class . Use scanner to accept user i/ps.
		
		1.6.1 Create 3 customers using 3 different constructors(2.1 : c1, 2.2 : c2, 2.3 : c3 )
		
		1.6.2 Display customer details of all customers.
        
		1.6.3 Prompt user, for changing creditLimit of the c3.
		
		1.6.4 Display new credit limit on the console.
