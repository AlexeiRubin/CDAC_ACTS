Implement ADD, MULTIPLY, FIND MAXIMUM, FIND MINIMUM using an array of function pointers instead of using switch statement.

1). Functions are separate and have their own input and result is printed inside the function only.

2). Arguments are passed to the functions and the result is returned to main.

3). Arguments are passed to the functions and the result is returned to main. (choice of input numbers given everytime).
